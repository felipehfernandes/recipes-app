# Recipes App!

  <summary><strong>üë®‚Äçüíª What was developed</strong></summary><br />

  A recipe app was developed in a group, using the most modern within the React ecosystem: Hooks and Context API!

  It is possible to: view, search, filter, favorite and follow the progress of preparing food and drink recipes!

  ‚ö†Ô∏è The database is made up of 2 distinct APIs, one for food and one for drinks.

  The layout focuses on mobile devices, so all prototypes will be developed on smaller screens.

  In this project, I was able to:

  -Use _Redux_ to manage state
   - Use the _React-Redux_ library
   - Use the _React_ Context API to manage state
   - Using the _React Hook useState_
   - Using the _React Hook useContext_
   - Using the _React Hook useEffect_
   - Create custom Hooks

      The [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) is an open, community-maintained database of recipes and ingredients from around the world.

      The endpoints are quite rich, you can [see them here](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)

      Very similar (even maintained by the same entity) the TheMealDB API, only focused on drinks.

      The endpoints are also quite rich, you can [see them here](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
